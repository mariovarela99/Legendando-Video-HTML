Juice Wrld - Remind Of the summer
 
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I crossed my tears and dilate my eyes

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I live with her in mind

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They say livin' life is free, I’ll have to deny

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.000
Cause everyday I pay the price

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I crossed my tears and dilate my eyes

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I live with her in mind

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.300
They say livin' life is free, I’ll have to deny

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.000
Cause everyday I pay the price

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I wake up feelin' like last night was a wild car ride

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Welcome to the fast life

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.600
I pop these, watch how the time flies

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.000
Outer-space, black skies lookin’ like sci-fi

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But that's only half of me

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That's only half of me, that's one side

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.300
But don't be sad with me

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.000
And don't feel bad for me, it's alright

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.000
Addictions remind me of the summer

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
'Mind you, I was younger

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.400
Trying to kill my hunger, yeah

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.000
Addictions remind me of the summer

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
'Mind you, I was younger

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.400
Trying to kill my hunger, yeah

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.000
Percocets, nicotine, red promethazine

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Good sex, fast cars, I’d crash anything

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That is a smoke screen, none of those things make me happy

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Sold my soul, now I can buy anything

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Sad but I'm not a bitch, don’t try anything

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
'Cause I'll kill gladly, that's the only thing that make me happy

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Turn the frown off when the racks in

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.800
Ain’t no fentanyl up in my xans

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
If I could end all of the withdrawls

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I would, but sadly, I can't

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Thinkin' back, it probably started with the vyvanse

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now I'm starin' at oxycodin in my hand

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Rehab'll only ruin my plans

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
On the bright side, I'm makin' progression

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.700
I was takin' four, now I'm takin' one less

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.700
'Til I drop the codiene in the Sunkist

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.900
Said fuck it, grabbed the pint and poured the whole shit

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Addictions remind me of the summer

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
'Mind you, I was younger

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Trying to kill my hunger, yeah

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Addictions remind me of the summer

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.800
'Mind you, I was younger

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.000
Trying to kill my hunger, yeah
